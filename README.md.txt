# python-api-challenge

Several notes from the first homework submission:

1.  Hotel map with pins was in the same folder as the 12 png files.
2.  File of cities was inside the code; now in a separate csv file within the output_data.
3.  API Keys temporarily removed because of compromised API Key. New Key included.
4.  The data frame was already included, but was missed in the original submission.
5.  Written descriptions were placed in the original submission.  Moved into more visible location.
6.  Three trends available at the bottom of the file. 
7.  Please navigate to output_data and starter_code for all homework.
